    "Where to start": "The login form communicates with a database which stores usernames and passwords in one of its tables. However, you do not need to know, discover or extract the credentials to bypass the login."
    "Database": "The webpage uses PHP, and the database uses SQL. It is possible to misuse the potential weakness in the authentication process by injecting malicious input."
    "Input": "The input from input fields is placed directly into an SQL query as it is. In case of unexpected input (like an extra '), you could convince SQL to execute entirely different code than it's supposed to."

    "Database interaction": "Use the [SQL] button in the web shell to interact with log into local databases and interact with them using SQL queries."
